                        Highly Classified is the beloved brainchild of Coco Day and was founded in 2023. Her
                        mission: create

                    Coco is a full-time circus person, instructing all levels of students at Circus Collective, Gravity
                    Aerial Arts, and Fly Mile High.
                    In addition to performing, she is the proud producer, creative director, chief marketing officer,
                    and founder of Highly Classified.

                    Coco happened upon an aerial yoga class in Phoenix, AZ in 2014, and attended classes religiously. It
                    helped that the aerial school was in an old church! Aerial class was the best part of her week, so
                    she soon took a deep dive into the world of trapeze, hammock, lyra, and silks. She has trained
                    several aerial disciplines but is primarily interested in vertical apparatus. Coco has recently
                    fallen head over heels with rope as it poses new challenges and allows for momentum and dynamic
                    movements. Coco has trained under Holly Dison and Rebekah Leach which ignited her passion for aerial
                    theory.

                    She moved to Denver in the summer of 2016 to spread her wings and feels extremely lucky to be
                    surrounded by all the aerial opportunities in Colorado. She specializes in curating looks for
                    costuming, teaching private parties and event planning.
